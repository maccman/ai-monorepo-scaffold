## Web search and research using Perplexity

Use the `mcp_perplexity-ask_perplexity_search` tools to answer questions. You should use this instead of the `web_search` tool because it is a lot more accurate.

Give the tool a full question and include all the relevant context, rather than generic search terms.

## NPM package, documentation, interfaces and code search

Use the `Context7` MCP server tools to search for NPM packages, documentation, TypeScript interfaces and code.

First resolve the package library ID using `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id`, then use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` to get the documentation.

Before using any NPM package, read its documentation and understand its interfaces. Always combine this with a Perplexity search for additional usage information.
