# Cursor Plan Mode

Plan Mode transforms complex coding tasks by creating detailed plans before writing code. Instead of jumping into implementation, Cursor researches your codebase, asks clarifying questions, and creates an editable roadmap.

## Why Plan Mode

Traditional AI assistants dive straight into code, leading to:

- Misaligned implementations
- Missing critical context
- Rework from misunderstandings
- Difficulty with multi-step tasks

Plan Mode solves this by:

- **Frontloading context** - Researches codebase thoroughly first
- **Ensuring alignment** - Clarifies requirements before coding
- **Providing transparency** - You see and approve the plan
- **Enabling longer runs** - Agents work on complex tasks systematically
- **Improving quality** - Significantly better code generation

## How to Use

### 1. Activate Plan Mode

**Manual:** Press `Shift + Tab` in agent input

**Automatic:** Cursor suggests it for complex tasks

### 2. Planning Process

**Stage 1: Research**

Cursor automatically:

- Searches relevant files
- Reviews documentation
- Analyzes patterns and architecture
- Identifies dependencies

**Stage 2: Clarifying Questions**

Cursor asks targeted questions:

- Implementation preferences
- Design decisions
- Data storage requirements
- UI/UX choices

**Tip:** Answer with detail. Quality answers = quality plans.

**Stage 3: Plan Generation**

Creates comprehensive Markdown plan with:

- File structure (created/modified files)
- Code references (specific locations)
- To-do list (step-by-step breakdown)
- Dependencies (task order)
- Architecture decisions

### 3. Review and Edit

The plan is fully editable:

- Click into Markdown to make changes
- Add/remove to-do items
- Modify implementation details
- Adjust scope or approach

### 4. Execute

Click "Build" to start:

- Entire plan loads into context
- AI assigned full to-do list
- Progress tracked: pending → in progress → complete
